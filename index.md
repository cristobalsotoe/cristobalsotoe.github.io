    title: About me
    text: I am a Civil Engineer with a strong interest in hydrology and climate. My work focuses on the analysis of extreme precipitation events in the context of a changing climate, the application of gridded datasets (such as precipitation, temperature, and evapotranspiration) in hydrological studies, and the integrated modeling of surface and groundwater systems using coupled hydrological models.
